# electricity_load_prediction_project
 This is a machine learning project where I built a model to predict daily electricity load using time series data from 2023. ðŸ“Š I used Python, pandas, and scikit-learn to analyze, preprocess, and model the data.  This project helped me understand how ML can be applied in real-world forecasting problems.
